* My day goes generally like this:

- Punch in with =F9-I= (this starts the clock on the default task)
- Look at the agenda and make a mental note of anything important to deal with today
- Read email and news
  - create notes, and tasks for things that need responses with org-capture with =C-c c=
- Check refile tasks and respond to emails with =C-c C-w=
- Look at my agenda and work on important tasks for today
  - Clock it in with =I=
  - Work on it until it is =DONE= or it gets interrupted
- Work on tasks
- Make journal entries (=C-c c j=) for interruptions
- Punch out for lunch and punch back in after lunch with =F9-O=
- work on more tasks
- Refile tasks to empty the list with =C-c C-w= 
  - Tag tasks to be refiled with =m= collecting all tasks for the same target
  - Bulk refile the tasks to the target location with =B r=
  - Repeat (or refile individually with =C-c C-w=) until all refile tasks are gone
- Mark habits done today as DONE
- Punch out at the end of the work day
 

I'll work on this file in the following sequence:

1. I punch in with =F9-I= at the start of my day

   That clocks in the =Organization= task by id in my =todo.org= file.

2. =F12-SPC= to review my block agenda

   Pick 'TODO Some miscellaneous task' to work on next and clock that in with =I=
   The clock is now on 'TODO Some miscellaneous task'

3. I complete that task and mark it done with =C-c C-t d=

   This stops the clock and moves it back to the =Organization= task.

4. Now I want to work on =Project A= so I clock in =Task 1=

   I work on Task 1 and mark it =DONE=.  This clocks out =Task 1= and moves
   the clock to =Project A=.  Now I work on =Task 2= and clock that in.


- Use the clock history C-u C-c C-x C-i
  Go back to something I was clocking that is not finished
- Pick something off today's block agenda
  =SCHEDULED= or =DEADLINE= items that need to be done soon
- Pick something off the =NEXT= tasks agenda view
  Work on some unfinished task to move to completion
- Pick something off the other task list 
- Use an agenda view with filtering to pick something to work on


* Reports

To get a report of time spent on tasks for =XYZ.org= you simply visit
the =XYZ.org= file and run an agenda clock report for the last month
with =F12 < a v m b R=.  This limits the agenda to this one file,
shows the agenda for a full month, moves to last month, and generates
a clock report.
